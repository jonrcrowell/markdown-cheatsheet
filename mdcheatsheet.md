# Markdown Cheatsheet

Text entered on multiple lines in your editor will appear on a single line in your markdown doc. You must entered two carriage returns for markdown to create a new paragraph.

For example, the word "one", "two", "three", and "four" below are entered on separate lines in the text editor, but they appear on a single line in markdown:

one
two
thre
four

If the words are entered with two carriage returns, they appear on separate lines in Markdown:

one

two

three

four

### Bold and Italics

Surrounding text with asterisks or underscores will *italicize* or **bold** the text. A single *asterisk* or _underscore_ on either side of the text will italicize it, and two **asterisks** or __underscores__ on either side bolds the text.

This can be confusing. I follow a convention suggested by Wes Bos, and that is to always use **double asterisks** for bold and _single underscores_ for italic.

### Strikethrough

Surround text with ~~double tildes~~ for strikethrough.
